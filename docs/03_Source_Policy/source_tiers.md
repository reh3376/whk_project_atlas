# Source tiers (truth firewall)

We prefer real evidence. However, engineering lives partly in the realm of practice.

## Tier A — Peer reviewed (default)
Allowed by default. Examples:
- ACM / IEEE / USENIX conferences and journals
- Peer-reviewed surveys and empirical SE research

## Tier B — Standards/specifications (allowed, label clearly)
Not peer-reviewed, but authoritative:
- IETF RFCs
- W3C / ISO / NIST publications

## Tier C — Vendor/OSS documentation (allowed, label implementation-specific)
Useful for “how to implement”, not for “what is true”.

## Tier D — Non-peer-reviewed (discouraged; require warning)
Blogs, talks, informal writeups.
Allowed only if explicitly labeled:
> WARNING: Non-peer-reviewed. Treat as hypothesis / practice report.

## Minimum standard for any claim
- Prefer citations.
- If no strong evidence exists, say so.
- Separate:
  - observed facts
  - assumptions
  - working theory
