# MLOps + SME Supervision — Start Here

## Goal
Design orchestrator + evaluation harness for human-in-the-loop ML-heavy optimization workflows.

## Outputs (deliverables)
- Design docs (using `02_Templates/design_doc_template.md`)
- ADRs (using `02_Templates/adr_template.md`)
- Prototype code (minimal but real, with tests)
- Checklists/runbooks relevant to this phase
- Sprint retro

## Sprints
- Sprint 04.1 (define in `Sprints/`)
- Sprint 04.2 (optional)

## How to run this phase
1. Review `04_Memory_and_Handoff/PROJECT_STATE.md` and set this phase as current.
2. Create/complete sprint brief(s) under `Sprints/`.
3. Ship deliverables under `Deliverables/`.
4. Update `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `DECISION_JOURNAL.md`.
5. Regenerate `CONTEXT_PACKET.md`.

## References
Add peer-reviewed sources under `References/` and index them in `03_Source_Policy/references.bib`.
