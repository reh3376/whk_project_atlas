# Scope

In scope:
- Architecture frameworks and decision-making artifacts (design docs, ADRs, reviews).
- SDLC process and automation (CI/CD, testing strategy, quality gates, environment standardization).
- Data pipeline design for curated datasets (schemas, metadata, lineage, periodic snapshots).
- Practical prototypes and reference implementations (small, testable, benchmarked).
- Operational readiness: observability, reliability practices, secure SDLC basics.

Out of scope (unless explicitly added later):
- Large-scale UI/UX research.
- Deep model research (novel architectures) beyond what is needed for production MLOps and supervised orchestration.
- Long-term cloud-native optimization (since on-prem is the priority), except where useful for temporary scaffolding.

Non-goals:
- “Best practices” without evidence or a clear operational test.
- Big-bang process rewrites without adoption strategy.
