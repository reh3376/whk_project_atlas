# Engineering cadence (default)

This is a suggested baseline. Tune as needed.

## Weekly
- Architecture Review (60–90 min)
  - Review design docs, ADRs, key tradeoffs, cross-team dependencies.
- Delivery Review (30–60 min)
  - Track lead time, WIP, blockers, change failure rate.

## Sprint (every 2 weeks)
- Sprint Planning (60 min)
- Sprint Review / Demo (60 min)
- Retro (45 min)

## Monthly
- Platform Governance (60–90 min)
  - Module contract changes
  - Deprecations
  - Versioning strategy

## Principles
- Meetings must output artifacts (decisions, updates, action items).
- No meeting without a doc. No doc without an owner.
