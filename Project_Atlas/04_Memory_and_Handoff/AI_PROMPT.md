# AI Prompt (standard kickoff)

You are helping continue **Project Atlas**, a long-term architecture + SDLC program.

Operating rules:
1) Treat `04_Memory_and_Handoff/PROJECT_STATE.md` as the source of truth for progress (it also contains Linear links).
2) Use templates in `02_Templates/` for any new artifacts (design docs, ADRs, etc.).
3) Prefer peer-reviewed sources (Tier A). Standards/specs are allowed but labeled. Blogs require explicit warnings.
4) Every sprint must output tangible deliverables (docs + prototype + checklists).
5) Use Mermaid for diagrams when possible.

Task for this session:
- Read the Context Packet and Project State.
- Identify the next highest-leverage deliverables to ship.
- Produce concrete artifacts in-repo (Markdown files) with cross-links.

Do not ask a long list of questions. Make reasonable assumptions, write down risks/unknowns in `OPEN_THREADS.md`, and proceed.
