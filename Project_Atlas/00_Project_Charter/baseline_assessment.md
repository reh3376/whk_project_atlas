# Baseline Assessment

_Last updated: 2025-12-14_

Purpose: capture your starting point so improvements are measurable.

## Rating Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | No exposure / cannot explain basics |
| 1 | Familiar with concepts; limited hands-on experience |
| 2 | Can apply in practice; have shipped work using this skill |
| 3 | Can teach others; have made architectural decisions in this area |

## Quick Self-Assessment (0-3)

> **Instructions**: Replace `[?]` with your honest rating (0-3). Add brief notes on experience.

| Skill Area | Rating | Notes / Evidence |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| Architecture tradeoffs (boundaries, coupling, change tolerance) | 1 | Familiar with concepts; no practical implementation experience |
| SDLC design (CI/CD, testing strategy, release patterns) | 2 | CI/CD with GitHub Actions; unit/integration/e2e testing; branching strategies; solo developer |
| Distributed systems fundamentals | 1.5 | Mixed knowledge with gaps; non-standard solo approaches |
| Observability (logs/metrics/traces) | 1 | Using CodeRabbit for repo logging; non-standard solo practices |
| Reliability/SRE (SLOs, incident response) | 1.5 | Non-standard solo approaches; needs team-oriented practices |
| Security fundamentals (threat modeling, authn/authz) | 2 | Strong understanding of auth, secrets management, threat modeling |
| Data engineering (schemas, lineage, idempotency) | 1.75 | 30 years data experience; Applied Math & EE background; non-standard methodology |
| MLOps (evaluation, drift, monitoring) | 1.5 | Extensive ML algorithm math; advanced process control implementation |
| Team process leadership (cadence, alignment, adoption) | 2 | Engineering team leadership; limited software dev team collaboration |

### Summary Statistics

- **Total Score**: 14.25 / 27
- **Strongest Areas**: SDLC design, Security fundamentals, Team process leadership, Data engineering domain knowledge
- **Growth Priority Areas**: Team-oriented development practices, standard frameworks and terminology, collaborative workflows

### Key Insight

Strong technical foundation with deep domain expertise in data, mathematics, and engineering. Primary development pattern has been solo work, leading to effective but non-standard approaches. **Core growth objective: Adopting industry-standard practices, terminology, and team-oriented software development workflows.**

## Objective Exercises (Recommended)

These exercises validate self-assessment ratings with tangible artifacts. Complete during Phase 00-01.

| Exercise | Status | Artifact Link | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| Write a design doc for a modular platform core + plugin system | [ ] Not started | | Target: Phase 01 |
| Implement a minimal plugin loader and versioned interface in Python | [ ] Not started | | Target: Phase 01 |
| Implement a small C library callable from Python for a compute-heavy function | [ ] Not started | | Target: Phase 01 |
| Build a "toy" pipeline that snapshots curated data with lineage metadata | [ ] Not started | | Target: Phase 03 |
| Produce an SLO and a load test for a simple API | [ ] Not started | | Target: Phase 05 |
