# Baseline Assessment

_Last updated: 2025-12-14_

Purpose: capture your starting point so improvements are measurable.

## Rating Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | No exposure / cannot explain basics |
| 1 | Familiar with concepts; limited hands-on experience |
| 2 | Can apply in practice; have shipped work using this skill |
| 3 | Can teach others; have made architectural decisions in this area |

## Quick Self-Assessment (0-3)

> **Instructions**: Replace `[?]` with your honest rating (0-3). Add brief notes on experience.

| Skill Area | Rating | Notes / Evidence |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| Architecture tradeoffs (boundaries, coupling, change tolerance) | [1] | _e.g., "Led redesign of X service"_ |
| SDLC design (CI/CD, testing strategy, release patterns) | [2] | _e.g., "Set up GitHub Actions for Y"_ |
| Distributed systems fundamentals | [1] | _e.g., "Built message queue consumers"_ |
| Observability (logs/metrics/traces) | [1] | _e.g., "Implemented Prometheus metrics"_ |
| Reliability/SRE (SLOs, incident response) | [1] | _e.g., "On-call rotation experience"_ |
| Security fundamentals (threat modeling, authn/authz) | [1] | _e.g., "Implemented OAuth2 flow"_ |
| Data engineering (schemas, lineage, idempotency) | [2] | _e.g., "Built ETL pipelines"_ |
| MLOps (evaluation, drift, monitoring) | [1] | _e.g., "Deployed model to production"_ |
| Team process leadership (cadence, alignment, adoption) | [2] | _e.g., "Led sprint ceremonies"_ |

### Summary Statistics
