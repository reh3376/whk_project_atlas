# Citation rules

## In Markdown
- Prefer DOI links for peer-reviewed work.
- If you summarize a paper, link to the DOI or publisher page.

## In BibTeX
Use `03_Source_Policy/references.bib` as the canonical index.

## Labeling
Every reference should be labeled with a tier (A/B/C/D).

## When evidence is weak
Do not “launder” a blog idea as truth.
Write the warning in-line and treat it as a hypothesis to test.

## Internal linking
When a doc depends on another internal doc:
- link it with a relative link
- include a short “Dependency” section
